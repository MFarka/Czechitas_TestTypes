    <h1>Sanity Testing vs. Smoke Testing</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Smoke Testing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Smoke testing, often referred to as a "build verification test," ensures that the core functions of an application work after a new build or release. The goal is to check that the software is stable enough for further testing.</li>
          <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Covers the most critical and basic functionalities of the application. It is a high-level test to verify stability, without diving into specifics.</li>
          <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Conducted at the very beginning of the testing cycle, usually before more detailed testing takes place.</li>
          <li><strong>Example:</strong> After a new build, a tester might run a smoke test to verify that the application launches, the login functionality works, and main pages load.</li>
        </ul>  
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Sanity Testing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Sanity testing is a more focused, shallow test that verifies specific functionality or bug fixes after minor changes have been made. The goal is to confirm that a particular area of the application is working correctly without introducing new issues.</li>
          <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Narrower than smoke testing; it focuses only on specific functions or components impacted by recent changes.</li>
          <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Conducted later in the testing cycle, typically after smoke testing and once a stable build has been established.</li>
          <li><strong>Example:</strong>  If a bug fix was made in the shopping cart, a sanity test would verify that the shopping cart works as expected without testing unrelated areas of the application.</li>
        </ul>  
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Summary of Differences</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Smoke Testing</strong> is a <strong>broad, initial test</strong> to check core stability, ensuring the build is stable for further testing.</li>
            <li><strong>Sanity Testing</strong> is a <strong>narrow, focused test</strong> conducted to check the accuracy of recent changes or bug fixes within specific areas of the application.</li>
        </ul>
