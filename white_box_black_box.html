    <h1>Black Box Testing vs. White Box Testing</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Black Box Testing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Black-box testing focuses on the functionality of the software without any knowledge of the internal code or structure. Itâ€™s aimed at verifying that the application behaves as expected for different inputs and outputs.</li>
          <li><strong>Tester's knowledge:</strong> Testers do not need access to the source code or an understanding of how the code is written.</li>
          <li><strong>Techniques:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Equivalence Partitioning:</strong> Dividing input data into equivalent groups to reduce test cases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Boundary Value Analysis:</strong> Testing at the boundaries of input ranges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision Table Testing:</strong> Using tables to map combinations of inputs and expected outputs.</li>
                </ul>   
          <li><strong>Example:</strong> Testing a login feature by inputting valid and invalid credentials to check if the login function allows or denies access appropriately.</li>
        </ul> 
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>White Box Testing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition:</strong> White-box testing, also known as clear-box or glass-box testing, involves testing the internal workings of an application. Testers have access to the source code and write tests based on the code's structure and logic.</li>
          <li><strong>Tester's knowledge:</strong> Testers need to understand the code, architecture, and logic of the system to create test cases that cover various code paths.</li>
          <li><strong>Techniques:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Path Testing:</strong> Testing each possible path in the code to ensure coverage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loop Testing:</strong> Testing loops within the code to prevent infinite loops and boundary issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Condition Testing:</strong> Testing different conditional statements and decision points.</li>
                </ul>   
          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Unit testing, integration testing, and security testing often use white-box methods.</li>
        </ul> 
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Summary of Differences</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Black-Box Testing</strong> is concerned with what the software does (functional behavior) without looking "inside" the system, while <strong>White-Box Testing</strong> is focused on how the software works (internal logic and code).</li>
            <li><strong>Testers in Black-Box</strong> are generally end-users or QA teams, while <strong>Testers in White-Box</strong> are often developers or testers with coding knowledge.</li>
        </ul>
