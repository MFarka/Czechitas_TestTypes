    <h1>Software Testing Types</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Integration Testing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Integration testing is conducted to ensure that different modules or components of an application work together as expected. This type of testing is important for identifying interface and communication issues between separate parts of the software.</li>
          <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Tests are typically limited to interactions between specific modules or subsystems, rather than covering the entire application.</li>
          <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Often conducted by developers or testers, integration testing can be performed using approaches like top-down, bottom-up, or sandwich testing, depending on how the modules are integrated.</li>
          <li><strong>Example:</strong> If the login and profile modules are developed separately, integration testing would verify that after logging in, user-specific information loads correctly from the profile module.</li>
        </ul>  
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. End-to-End (E2E) Testing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> E2E testing aims to verify that the entire application works as expected, testing workflows from the start to finish. It simulates real user scenarios to ensure the system&apos;s components interact well together in the complete user experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Broader than integration testing, E2E covers the full workflow to test all functionalities and integrations as a whole. This ensures that the application works seamlessly in production-like environments.</li>
          <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Conducted by QA teams, often involving test automation. It includes validating UI, backend, databases, network, and third-party services.</li>
          <li><strong>Example:</strong> An E2E test in an e-commerce site might involve selecting a product, checking out, and confirming the order placement and email notification.</li>
        </ul> 
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> UAT is the final testing phase, aimed at ensuring the software meets user requirements and business objectives. It is the last step before software release and focuses on validating that the product meets the needs of the end user.</li>
          <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Limited to critical, user-focused workflows and requirements. The goal is not exhaustive testing but rather ensuring the application is usable and meets business needs.</li>
          <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Typically performed by end users or stakeholders, UAT involves testing real-world scenarios. Users confirm if the software does what it is supposed to, based on acceptance criteria.</li>
          <li><strong>Example:</strong> For an HR application, UAT might include users verifying that they can accurately enter employee details, generate payroll, and view reports without technical assistance.</li>
        </ul> 
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p><strong>Integration Testing</strong> focuses on <strong>interaction between modules.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>E2E Testing</strong> validates <strong>complete user flows</strong> in production-like environments.</p>
    <p><strong>UAT</strong> ensures the application <strong>meets user requirements</strong> and is ready for release.</p>
